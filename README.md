# Sentence Level Emotion Detection using Deep Learning Algorithm (BiLSTM)
# Project Description
The project, titled "Sentence-Level Emotion Detection using Deep Learning (BiLSTM)", aims to identify human emotions from short text inputs. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques for preprocessing and uses a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model to classify emotions into six categories: joy, sadness, anger, fear, love, and surprise. The system is trained on a labeled dataset of sentences and employs techniques like tokenization, padding, label encoding, and lemmatization. The model is deployed using a user-friendly Streamlit web app, allowing real-time emotion prediction from user input. My project demonstrates the effective combination of NLP and deep learning for sentiment-aware applications.
